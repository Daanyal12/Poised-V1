# Poised-V1
This is my first capstone of level 2 java being the POISED project tracker
This program is an OOP based system that allows a construction company to keep track of all their projects this is done by a project class and a person class

PROJECT
The project class takes all the details in of a project such as deadline, amount paid, project name etc
it then creates a project object of this data and stores it in the system

PERSON
The person class allows the company to store the details of the customer, architect and contractor that worked on the project 
once their details are entered the system then stores it
